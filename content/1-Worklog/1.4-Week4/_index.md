### Week 4 Achievements:

- Gained a clear understanding of **pipeline automation models** (event-driven and scheduled) used in modern data platforms.  
- Practiced **monitoring, logging, and alerting** for the data platform using **CloudWatch**.  
- Evaluated the **overall architecture** of the Reddit Data Platform and identified potential bottlenecks.
